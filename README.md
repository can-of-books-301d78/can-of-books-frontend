# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.
